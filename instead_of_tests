# We don't have any unit tests.
# To reduce the risk of getting new bugs, here are some commands that
# to some extent may replace the need for unit tests. What to look for
# is that the code compiles and runs without errors _and_ that the output
# looks reasonable.

tools/compileAndRun matrixC19
tools/compileAndRun matrixDemo
tools/compileAndRun cov-sim
tools/compileAndRun gen-sw
# followed by:
bin/gen-sw -o -N 10000 -k 10 -p 0.001 | bin/gen-sw -or -N 5000 -k 15 -p 0.003 > sw-2R-fromFile.txt
bin/cov-sim -ip < sw-2R-fromFile.json

# Also - requires only `tools/compileAndRun cov-sim` beforehand:
bin/cov-sim -ip < sw-2Regions.json
bin/cov-sim -ip < sw-3Regions.json
