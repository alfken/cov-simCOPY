# cov-sim
Covid simulator using Microscopic Agent-Based Model.

For the time being, there are **two** source files containing a `main` function, namely `cov-sim.cpp` and `matrix_test.cpp`.

Compile and run with default values by doing either of:

- `tools/compileAndRun cov-sim`
- `tools/compileAndRun matrix_test`

Once an executable binary file runs without errors and you don't want to make any more changes to the source code, simply run it as: `bin/cov-sim` or `bin/matrix_test` with or without arguments.

This is work in progress!

# Settings

The `cov-sim` exacutable can be run using a json-formatted settings stream as input. This executable can also output the results of the simulation as json. This can be shown e.g. by running `bin/cov-sim 1 < settings.json > output.json`. Note that the `cov-sim` executable will run with default settings if it has no command line arguments, and will run with the standard input if any command line argument exists (we should make this work with something like a flag instead).

The settings file is structured as follows. Note that any value can be omitted, in which case it will be set to a default value.

```
{
	"select_all": /* Whether all neighbours get infection attempts each step or just some */,
	"N": /* The number of initial infected */,
    	"T": /* The number of simulation time steps */,
	"T_v": /* The time step at which vaccination starts */,
	"n_v": /* The number of vaccinations available at each time step */,
	"groups": [], /* See more below */
	"graph": {} /* See more below */
}
```

The settings for the groups is an array of objects of group parameters. These groups will be distributed randomly among agents when initializing the graph.

```
{
	"n_i": /* How many infection attempts if infected */,
	"n_ai": /* How many infection attempts if asymptomatic */,
	"s": /* How susceptible an agent is */,
	"p_i": /* How infectious an agent is if infected */,
	"p_ai": /* How infectious an agent is if asymptomatic */,
	"p_v": /* How probable a vaccine is to work */,
	"d_v": /* How long it takes for a vaccine to work */,
	"d_i": /* How many time steps until an infected agent is removed */,
	"d_ai": /* How many time steps until an asymptomatic agent is removed */,
	"a_p": /* How probable an agent is to become asymptomatic if infected */
}
```

The graph setting is a json object that depends on the type of graph that should be generated. The `"type"` field is used to decide which type of graph is created.

```
{
	"type": "matrix", // A graph representation of a matrix
	"size": /* The length of the side of the matrix */,
	"distance": /* The range of each agent in the matrix */
}
```

```
{
	"type": "file", // A graph based on a file
	"file_name": /* The name of the file being used */
}
```
