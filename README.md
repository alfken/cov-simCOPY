# cov-sim
Covid simulator using Microscopic Agent-Based Model.

For the time being, there are **two** source files containing a `main` function, namely `cov-sim.cpp` and `matrix_test.cpp`. To compile and run, do either of:

- `make clean_binaries && make cov-sim`
- `make clean_binaries && make matrix_test`

Once the file runs without errors and you don't want to make any changes to the source code, just do `make cov-sim` or `make matrix_test`. Or even simpler: `bin/cov-sim` or `bin/matrix_test`.

This is still work in progress! :-)
