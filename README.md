# cov-sim
Covid simulator using Microscopic Agent-Based Model.

For the time being, there are **two** source files containing a `main` function, namely `cov-sim.cpp` and `matrix_test.cpp`.

Compile and run with default values by doing either of:

- `tools/compileAndRun cov-sim`
- `tools/compileAndRun matrix_test`

Once an executable binary file runs without errors and you don't want to make any more changes to the source code, simply run it as: `bin/cov-sim` or `bin/matrix_test` with or without arguments.

This is work in progress!
